# An Improved and Generalised Analysis for Spectral Clustering
This repository contains the jupyter notebook for constructing the figures and experiments in the paper "An Improved and Generalised Analysis for Spectral Clustering".

To run the notebook, simply install the requirements packages in the requirements.txt file and run the notebook. The notebook will guide you through the process of reproducing the figures and experiments in the paper.

Running the entire notebook titled `experiments-and-figures.ipynb` will produce the figures (some unused in the paper) in the `Figures` folder. The values for the table will be printed as output in the notebook. The notebook titled `SBM-threshold-experiments.ipynb` will produce the figures from the appendix on SBMs with edge probabilities close to the detectable threshold.
